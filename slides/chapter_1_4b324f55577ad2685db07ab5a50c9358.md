In this lesson we will learn the methods and techniques selecting the right graphs for continuous data

## Graphing continuous data: the strategy

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e590af97ff"
```

`@part1`
Selecting the right graph depends upon:

* The goal of our analysis
* The context in which the data is structured


`@script`
Graphing continuous data when working with surveys begins with selecting what kind of graph we need based upon two things;

* The goal of our analysis
* The context in which the data is structured

## Graphing continuous data: data structure

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4e5b54e536"
```

`@part1`
When our goal is well defined we then must know our data structure
* Are the continuous variables associated with categorical ones?
* Are we dealing with percentages or parts of a whole?
* Are we plotting continuous variables against each other?
* etc.

There are many possibilities to choose from, so lets focus on common important examples
