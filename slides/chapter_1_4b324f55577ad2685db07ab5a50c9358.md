In this lesson we will learn the methods and techniques selecting the right graphs for continuous data

## Graphing continuous data: the strategy

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e590af97ff"
```

`@part1`
Selecting the right graph depends upon:

* The goal of our analysis
* The context in which the data is structured


`@script`
Graphing continuous data when working with surveys begins with selecting what kind of graph we need based upon two things;

* The goal of our analysis
* The context in which the data is structured

## Graphing continuous data: data structure

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4e5b54e536"
```

`@part1`
When our goal is well defined we then must know our data structure
* Are the continuous variables associated with categorical ones?
* Are we dealing with percentages or parts of a whole?
* Are we plotting continuous variables against each other?
* etc.

There are many possibilities to choose from, so lets focus on common important examples

## A case example: Graphing for Hypothesis testing

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b8f189f122"
```

`@part1`
Hypothesis testing is a common goal

* Selecting the right hypothesis test depends upon data distribution shape

* To determine the shape, we construct a histogram.

Example scenario: We want the histogram of body height measurements for people to later hypothesis test if men and women are on average the same height.


`@script`
One common goal with survey data is hypothesis testing. But to perform a hypothesis test we must first determine the distribution shape of the data so we can select the right test. We can find the shape using a histogram.

In this example scenario we want to see the shape of the histogram for height (cm) so we can later determine what kind of hypothesis test to use.

## Building a histogram: select the data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0d0168d0ad"
```

`@part1`
We want a labeled, overlaying image of three histograms;
* general heights *(everyone)*
* male heights
* female heights


First we select the right data;

`everyone = df['Height'].values()`
`men = df[df['gender']=='male']['Height'].values()`
`women = df[df['gender']=='female']['Height'].values()`


`@script`
To build a histogram comparing the heights of men and women, we must isolate three components of the data:

* The mixture heights of both men and women
* The heights of men
* The heights of women

This allows us to compare all distributions on a plot to see how they look relative to each other.

## Building a histogram: using matplotlib

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a782026501"
```

`@part1`
Then we input each series into matplotlib's histogram function, using `plt.hist()`

We also must specify
* label names
* colors
* opacity (alpha)
* that we want a legend/title


`@script`
To build a good histogram using mapltolibs hist function, we will also need to specify label names for the data, colors for each histogram to tell them apart, the opacity of each graphic, and that we want a legend/title in the image


---
## Using the hist function in matplotlib

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e77c41ac9b"
```

`@part1`
The parameters we specify go into the histogram function accordingly:

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`plt.hist(data, color='Red',label='name',alpha=1)`


`@script`
As you can see, using the histogram function is pretty simple. The hist function comes after the plt prefix and we specify the parameters inside.

## Coding the plot

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a15906d693"
```

`@part1`
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(male,bins=10,color='Red',label='male')
plt.hist(female,bins=10,color='Blue',alpha=0.75,label='female')
plt.hist(everyone,bins=10,color='Green',alpha=0.3,label='everyone')
plt.title('Height histograms')
plt.xlabel("centimeters")
plt.ylabel("frequency")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


`@script`
Here we use the histogram function for every time we want a new histogram in the image, and we specify the colors and labels accordingly.
